## How does this work?

Check out my blog post: TBD

## Install

- Download and install AutoHotKey V1 from [autohotkey.com](https://www.autohotkey.com/)
- Download `AutoHotKey-ChatGPT.zip` from the [Releases](https://github.com/mxro/autohotkey-chatgpt-voice/releases) for the latest release.
- Extract `AutoHotKey-ChatGPT.zip`
- Edit `config.json` from the extracted files. Provide your [Open API Key](https://www.howtogeek.com/885918/how-to-get-an-openai-api-key/) for the property `OpenapiKey`.

```json
{
  "OpenapiKey": "",
  "AutoHotKeyExec": ".\\bin\\autohotkey-1.1.37.01\\AutoHotkeyU64.exe"
}
```

## Usage

- Double click on `watch.ahk` from the extracted files
- Press F8
- Speak into your microphone what you would like to do
- Press F8
- Wait for Open AI and AutoHotKey to do their magic

## Customise

### Trigger Hotkey

The hotkey to start/stop a voice command is defined in `watch.ahk`. You can replace the following with a hotkey of your choice:

```
F8::
```

### Prompt

Among the extracted files, there is a `prompt.txt`. You can edit this to customise it to yor own needs.

For instance, the current prompt file defaults to using the [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) search engine. You can change this easily to any search engine you like, by modifying the following line in `prompt.txt`:

```
Unless otherwise specified, assume:
...
- the default search engine is DuckDuckGo
...
```
